# create-vive-project

Get up and running with a webvr powered vive prototype instantly.

create-vive-prototype is a boilerplate and command line utility to quickly create webvr prototypes using the HTC Vive and a WebVR enabled browser (or chrome with the [WebVR Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webvr-api-emulation/gbdnpaebafagioggnhkacnaaahpiefil?hl=en), highly highly recommended)

Projects created with this will get:
- Instant live reload
- modular JS bundling (browserify)
- glslify to handle shader packaging
- ES6 goodies
- It's just easy

# Install

```
npm install -g create-vive-project
create-vive-prototype YourNewProjectName
cd YourNewProjectName
npm start
```

Alternatively you can just download this repository install it manually if you don't want to install it globally

```
npm install
npm start
```

# Todo

- Make a way to have prototypes publishable in one step to github pages or something

# Suggestions

Any ideas for things you think most prototypes would want, either submit an issue or tweet me at @msfeldstein
