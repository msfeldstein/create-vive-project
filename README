# create-vive-prototype

create-vive-prototype is a boilerplate and command line utility to quickly create webvr prototypes using the HTC Vive and a WebVR enabled browser (or chrome with the [WebVR Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webvr-api-emulation/gbdnpaebafagioggnhkacnaaahpiefil?hl=en))

Projects created with this will get:
- Instant live reload
- modular JS bundling (browserify)
- glslify to handle shader packaging
- ES6 goodies
- It's just easy

# Install

`npm install -g create-vive-prototype`
`create-vive-prototype YourNewProjectName`
`cd YourNewProjectName`
`npm start`

Alternatively you can just download this repository install it manually if you don't want to install it globally
`npm install`
`npm start`
